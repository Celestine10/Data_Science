# Problem Statement:
According to WHO, in 2019, the top 10 causes of death accounted for 55% of the 55.4 million deaths worldwide.

The top global causes of death, in order of total number of lives lost, are associated with three broad topics: cardiovascular (ischaemic heart disease, stroke), respiratory (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections) and neonatal conditions â€“ which include birth asphyxia and birth trauma, neonatal sepsis and infections, and preterm birth complications.

Causes of death can be grouped into three categories:

Communicable (infectious and parasitic diseases and maternal, perinatal and nutritional conditions)
Noncommunicable (chronic)
Injuries
# Introduction
## GOAL: This project aims to carry out a detailed exploration and visualization of the leading causes of death globally using the 'Death Cause Reason by Country' datasets. The dataset can be found here .

The key points to consider are as follows:

- Total number of deaths per cause across the globe
- Analysis of the leading cause of death
- Analysis of the top 10 countries with the most recorded deaths from the leading cause.

# OBSERVATION
From our explorations, we can deduce the following from our data:

- Cadiovascular (All Heart realted) diseases has more victims and China has the highest number of deaths around the world.

- The total death toll from Cardiovascular diseases is 18,735,068

- The Total death from all the diseases contained in this dataset is 56,723,571.

- India leads the way for the number of deaths from Respiratory, Neonatal and Kidney diseases, with 1,168,381, 43800, and 222,922 respectively.

- India also lead the way with 422634 deaths from tuberculosis.

- Nigeria leads the way with 44,914 deaths from Meningitis and 191,106 from Malaria.

- The United States lead the way with 353,948 deaths from Covid-19.

- Conclusively, we can say that India has the highest cumulative number of deaths from all the disease categories put together as they rank amongst the top 2 or 3 in other categories.
